'Immutable' NodeJS module mocking for CJS (CommonJS) modules for unit testing purposes. Similar to [proxyquire](), but much simpler and more defensive.

**Easy to Use ðŸ˜ƒ**
- Much simpler than [proxyquire](). Straightforward documentation.
- Debugging utility.

**Defensive ðŸ›¡**
- Throws an error if any mocks are unused (not found in the module we are mocking).
- Module Cache for the module in question is always deleted before and after mocking to minimize side effects and make behavior more predictable. This approximates immutability.

**Robust & Reliable ðŸ’ª**
- Tiny codebase written in Typescript with only 1 dependency.

# Examples

## Hello World

_helloworld.ts_
```typescript
export function helloworld() {
  return 'hello, world';
}
```
_helloworld.spec.ts_
```typescript
import {test} from 'hoare';
import {helloworld} from './helloworld';

test('should return "hello, world"', (assert) => {
  assert.equal(helloworld(), 'hello, world');
});
```
## Valid Word

_isValidWord.ts_
```typescript
import {readFile} from 'fs/promises';

export async function isValidWord(word: string) {
  const validWords = await getValidWords();
  return validWords.indexOf(word) !== -1;
}

async function getValidWords() {
  const contents = await readFile('./dict.txt', 'utf-8');
  return contents.split('\n');
}
```
_isValidWord.spec.ts_
```typescript
import {test, mock} from 'hoare';
import * as mod from './isValidWord'; // just used for typing

const dict = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'].join('\n');
const mockMod: typeof mod = mock('./isValidWord', {
    'fs/promises': {readFile: () => Promise.resolve(dict)},
});

test('valid word returns true', async (assert) => {
  const result = await mockMod.isValidWord('dog');
  assert.equal(result, true);
});

test('invalid word returns false', async (assert) => {
  const result = await mockMod.isValidWord('nope');
  assert.equal(result, false);
});
```

# Installation

1. Install from npm along with peer dependencies:

    ```console
    npm i typescript ts-node c8 hoare -DE
    ```
2. Create an `.c8rc.json` file in the root of your project with the following:
    ```json
    {
        "extends": "@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript",
        "all": true,
        "exclude": [
            "**/*.spec.ts",
            "**/*.d.ts",
            "**/*.spec.js",
            "coverage",
            ".eslintrc.js",
            ".eslintrc",
            "tests",
            "test",
            "test_utils"
        ]
    }
    ```
3. Add the following command to your `package.json` `scripts` directive:
```json
{
  "test": "hoare"
}
```

# Basic Usage

1. Write your tests with a `.spec.ts` or `.spec.js` extension (although any extension will work, as long as it matches your glob in your `npm test` script). We highly recommend you put your spec files alongside your code, and not in a separate folder.
2. Simply run `npm test`.

# API

## Methods

### `test(title: string, cb: (assert: Assert) => void): void`

Create a test. `cb` can be an `async` function.

## Interfaces

### `Assert`

#### `equal(actual: any, expected: any, msg?: string): void`

Asserts deep and strict equality on objects or primitives. Unless your code is non-deterministic, [this should be the only assertion you need](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/rethinking-unit-test-assertions-55f59358253f).

#### `errorsEquivalent(err1: any, err2: any, msg?: string)`

Asserts that both errors are similar. Stack traces are ignored. It checks for both non-enumerable properties
(ie, `name` and `message`) and enumerable properties (anything added by extending `Error`).

Both errors **must** be an instance of `Error`, or an error will be thrown. See [validate.spec.ts](examples/validate.spec.ts) example.

# Inspiration, Philosophy & Attribution

`hoare` is named after [Sir Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) (aka C. A. R. Hoare), and the [Hoare triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic), the cornerstone of Hoare's axiomatic method of testing computer programs (what we largely consider unit testing today).

After years of working on [safety-critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system) and mission-critical software in healthcare, education and e-commerce, I have come to appreciate the importance of clean, readable, and maintainable unit tests and the profound effect they can have on the development of the code itself.

> The real value of tests is not that they detect bugs in the code, but that they detect inadequacies in the methods, concentration, and skills of those who design and produce the code. â€” C. A. R. Hoare

Good unit tests force programmers to break apart their code into smaller, more easily testable parts. Unfortunately, testing frameworks have become ever-complex to address deficiencies in design, when they should be doing the opposite.

> Inside every large program, there is a small program trying to get out. â€” C. A. R. Hoare

A unit test should act as a **_specification_** for the behavior of the code that we're testing. The Hoare triple, written as `{P} S {Q}`, provides a way for us to specify this expected behavior. Each part is a logical statement that must be true for the test to pass: `pre-condition`, `execution`, and `post-condition`. The Hoare triple is an easy way to reason about how a piece of code should behave, and a good unit test should clearly communicate this to the reader. I often use `given`, `when`, `then` in my unit tests.

Difficult-to-read unit tests also increase the likelihood of lack of maintenance, abandonment, or errors in the test itself. Bad tests are actually worse than not having a test at all&mdash;they could give false confidence or just add friction.

One of my biggest sources of inspiration is [Rethinking Unit Test Assertions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/rethinking-unit-test-assertions-55f59358253f) by [Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott).

Inspiration was also taken from other test frameworks [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [node-tap](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap).

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. â€” C. A. R. Hoare
